# excali-streamr

## Introduction

Introducing our latest project created during the Streamr Mini Hack by  D_D! We explored the power of the Streamr Network to bring an interactive Excalidraw experience to life. Our goal was to create a read-only environment that would allow publishers to edit the drawing and subscribers to watch the creation process. Although we started a bit late and didn't quite complete everything we had planned, the journey was an amazing learning experience. Through this project, we discovered the many possibilities offered by the Streamr Network and the potential for innovative applications that can be built on top of it.
